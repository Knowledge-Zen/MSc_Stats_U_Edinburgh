\section*{Generating Functions}\cite{generatingfunction3b1b}
\label{appendix:generatingfunction}

In the book \textit{102 Combinatorial Problems}, authored by Titu Andreeseu and Zuming Feng to train the USA team for the \textit{International Math Olympiad}, there is a seemingly innocent question, Problem No. 10 of Chapter 2: 

\textit{Find the number of subsets of {1, ...., 2000}, the sum of whose elements is divisible by 5.}

If we try to write a bruteforce program to find all subsets whose sum is divisble by 5 and count them, it's impossible to do so because the $2^{2000}$ is a massively huge number.
